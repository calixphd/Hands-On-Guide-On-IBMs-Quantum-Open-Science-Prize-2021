    "# Towards Solving IBM's Quantum Open Science Prize\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you find out whether to pursue a career in quantum computing? Almost three months ago, I [claimed](https://pyqml.medium.com/how-to-find-out-whether-to-pursue-a-career-in-quantum-computing-today-d1c7093811e8) the best way is to work on [IBM's Quantum Open Science Prize](https://research.ibm.com/blog/quantum-open-science-prize).\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is precisely what we did. In my previous posts, we worked through the nitty-gritty details of that challenge. IBM wants us to simulate a Heisenberg model Hamiltonian for a three-particle system on IBM Quantum’s 7-qubit Jakarta system using Trotterization.\n",
    "First, we learned that [the real challenge is not simulating a Heisenberg model Hamiltonian for a three-particle system. Instead, it is about how to do it on a noisy device](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-first-glimpse-at-ibms-quantum-open-science-price-challenge-de4a2f41987e). So, we [set up our development environment](https://pyqml.medium.com/how-to-set-up-jupyterlab-to-participate-in-ibms-quantum-open-science-prize-1a9d44b95bf6), looked at [how to use a real quantum computer](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-run-code-on-a-real-quantum-computer-c1fc61ff5b4), and [introduced ourselves to quantum error mitigation methods](https://pyqml.medium.com/how-to-tackle-ibms-quantum-open-science-prize-e6c7fc594154).\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose the [Clifford Data Regression (CDR) method](https://pyqml.medium.com/mitigating-quantum-errors-using-clifford-data-regression-98ab663bf4c6). In CDR, we use quantum circuits that we can simulate classically to train a noise model. This noise model lets us predict the noise-free value from a noisy one. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](./assets/cdr_steps.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented this method with Qiskit and Mitiq, and the results were promising, both in a [local simulation](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-implement-quantum-error-mitigation-with-qiskit-and-mitiq-e2f6a933619c) and [on a real quantum computer](https://towardsdatascience.com/practical-error-mitigation-on-a-real-quantum-computer-41a99dddf740). Unfortunately, we recognized that [we couldn't use the CDR method unless we rewrite the way IBM assesses the performance of our solution](https://towardsdatascience.com/just-another-ordinary-day-in-the-life-of-a-quantum-software-engineer-24689cd962ff). We refrained from doing that because it could disqualify our submission. Instead, [we decided to change our approach](https://towardsdatascience.com/towards-quantum-measurement-error-mitigation-e6f134883f34).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we looked at [how to mitigate the noise to meet IBM's expectations](https://towardsdatascience.com/towards-quantum-measurement-error-mitigation-e6f134883f34) and [mitigated the noise on the measurement level].\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we're now ready to put it all together.\n",

    "In the next step, we need to prepare the quantum training circuits. The challenge here is to use circuits that are representative of the problem but classically simulatable. The original CDR method achieves representability by building upon a linear relationship between the noisy and the noise-free expectation value of a circuit. Further, it uses circuits that consist of Clifford gates. These are gates that are classically simulatable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we can't use the expectation values, but we need to mitigate the noise on the measurement level. We can't build upon a linear relationship between the noisy and the noise-free values. Furthermore, the problem with the Heisenberg Hamiltonian simulation is its potential size. So, even though it consists entirely of Clifford gates, the overall circuit becomes intractable for any classical computer given a specific size. So, while a three-particle Heisenberg Hamiltonian is a piece of cake, a fifty-particle Heisenberg Hamiltonian is impossible to simulate classically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, we need to rethink our training data. We start with the trotterization algorithm provided by IBM. This algorithm contains at least four trotterization gates. In a previous post, we learned that the more trotterization gates, the better the performance without noise. However, the more trotterization gates we use, the more sensitive to noise the algorithm becomes. Without mitigation, this negative effect of noise exceeds the performance improvement. But with mitigation, it may make sense to use more than the minimum number of four trotterization gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For training, however, even the four trotterization gates are too big. We need shorter circuits. Fortunately, each trotter gate consists of three subcircuits, the `XX`, `YY`, and `ZZ` gate. So, the plan is to construct training circuits that contain only two out of the three subcircuits in a single trotterization gate.\n",

    "In general, this is the unchanged trotterization circuit of IBM. The `get_circuit` function provides a parameterizable interface to create the training circuits from it. The idea is that we can customize which subcircuits we want to include through the parameters `X`, `Y`, and `Z`. Unless we include all three subcircuits, we add only a single trotterization gate. For instance, if we have the `XX` and the `YY` gates, the function creates a circuit with these gates for a single trotter step. It is essential to mention that we need to use the intended number of trotterization steps because we use this number as a parameterization for qubit rotations. So, the circuits with a different number of trotter steps are entirely different.\n",

    "Furthermore, we do not create a single circuit each, but 27! The reason is the quantum state tomography IBM uses to assess the performance of our simulation. Quantum state tomography recreates a quantum state by looking at the quantum system from all exclusive angles. For a three-qubit system, these are $3^3=27$ angles. Each angle results in a slightly different quantum circuit. But these slight differences significantly affect the measurements. Essentially, we treat each of these circuits separately.\n",
