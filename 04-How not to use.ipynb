    "# How (Not) To Use Today’s Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Computers\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to approach IBM’s Quantum Open Science Prize**\n",
    "\n",
    "This post appeared first on [Medium](https://pyqml.medium.com/how-not-to-use-todays-noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum-computers-a1c4d8551190) and my weekly [email-course](https://pyqml.substack.com/p/how-not-to-use-todays-noisy-intermediate?s=w).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get into quantum computing, you inevitably hear about the noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices (NISQ) we have today. But those who point out these limitations rarely give helpful advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./assets/guilty.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I am guilty as charged, too!\n",
    "\n",
    "In a [previous post](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-does-nisq-mean-fadf1aa9fdd6), I explained what NISQ means. My conclusion that these devices require different algorithms, tools, and strategies wasn’t wrong. Yet, I didn’t provide much practical advice either.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, how to cope with quantum errors has been on my timetable for quite a while already. As a result, I collected a lot of unsorted “I gotta read this” resources on that topic. Yet, quantum algorithms can be pretty unfathomable in their own right. It’s hard enough to get through them in any way. So, I never felt the urge to renounce the amenities of a perfect error-free simulator — until now.\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM announced its second Quantum Open Science Prize. They ask for a solution to a quantum simulation problem. They want us to simulate a Heisenberg model Hamiltonian for a three-particle system on their 7-qubit Jakarta system using Trotterization.\n",
    "“Wouldn’t it be cool if I wrote a step-by-step guide on how to solve this kind of problem?” I thought. Of course, I suspected that the real challenge would not be to develop an algorithm that simulates a Heisenberg-Hamiltonian (even though that sounds pretty cool too). Instead, the real challenge would arguably be to deal with the shortcomings of an actual quantum device.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is not the appropriate situation to start coping with errors, what is? However, I had a suspicion that would be confirmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we refer to NISQ devices, we usually mean those quantum computers with a hundred qubits or less. So, the 7-qubit Jakarta system undoubtedly belongs to this category. The predominant characteristic of these devices is that there are too few qubits to correct quantum errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, I dug out my quantum computing books and bookmarks concerning error correction and took another deep dive. Quantum error correction is almost as old as quantum computing. When Peter Shor first developed his factorization algorithm, there were two main reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some were thrilled just by the thought of the possibilities that would open up. The others flatly rejected quantum computing altogether because they believed it was impossible to correct errors on a quantum computer.\n",
    "So, why couldn’t we?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time, the predominant way of dealing with faults on a digital computer was checkpointing. Basically, you take the intermediate state of your computation and write it down. And if the calculation derails after that point, you don’t have to start all over again, but you can go back to the checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that’s impossible on a quantum computer. If you [look at the quantum state of qubits in superposition](https://towardsdatascience.com/this-changes-the-way-you-see-quantum-computing-53fcebcac479), you inevitably collapse it. You can’t proceed afterward. And [you can’t copy qubits in superposition](https://towardsdatascience.com/quantum-computing-is-different-2178fba922cd), either. So, if we could not fix errors, we needed a computer that does the computation perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Factorizing any cryptographically important number using Shor’s algorithm takes around a billion steps. So, we would need to push the error rate below one error in a billion. That’s something even experimental physicists said to be absolutely impossible. The state-of-the-art was to perform a single two-qubit gate with an accuracy of 80%. So, thinking of a billion gates with an accuracy of less than one error altogether was just pathetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following year, Peter Shor presented a quantum error correction algorithm that didn’t rely on cloning. Instead, it built upon redundancy. You encode a single zero or one into three qubits. So, it gets zero, zero, zero, or one, one, one. And Shor showed how to correct a bit flip — that’s when a zero becomes a one or vice versa — in these encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the qubit superposition is not just a question of zero or one. A qubit has a phase. And a quantum computer can err in calculating that phase, too. So, Shor extended his algorithm to account for such phase errors as well. However, it implies encoding the triplet of qubits three times. So, it takes nine qubits to correct a single error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, this algorithm has prevented the belief in quantum computing from being completely abandoned. But, unfortunately, it is of little practical use — even today, 25 years later. Estimates say we would need around 1,000 of today’s physical qubits to create a single fault-tolerant logical qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, IBM presented its 127 (physical) qubit processor Eagle. Let me phrase it like this: We’re not there yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let’s get back to the IBM challenge of simulating a three-particle Heisenberg Hamiltonian with seven physical qubits. We certainly need more than a single qubit to simulate the Hamiltonian. And there will be more than one error. But seven qubits are not even enough to fix a single error.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is pretty clear that quantum error correction will not help us much to solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, it doesn’t need to! The challenge is not about quantum error correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum error correction aims to remove the impact of errors on quantum computations altogether. It is the study of algorithms that preserve the robustness of any quantum computation as long as the error rate remains below a certain threshold.\n",
    "However, the challenge does not ask for general robustness. Instead, it gives us a particular quantum algorithm — the simulation of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. And it gives us specific hardware — the 7-qubit Jakarta device.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge does not even ask for perfect accuracy. By contrast, the entry criterium is 30%. So, the challenge is to find a low-overhead method to improve the accuracy. The baseline accuracy is around 20%. This is what you can achieve without any support mechanism whatsoever.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we’re allowed to make some compromises. We’re looking for any method that more accurately and reliably estimates the observable. This is not the question of quantum error correction but quantum error mitigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum error mitigation aims to suppress errors on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices practically. And a large number of quantum error mitigation techniques have been proposed in the recent literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, an auspicious direction for mitigating the errors consists of leveraging the circuit’s specific structure being executed. One such approach is error mitigation by symmetry verification. This approach builds upon algorithms that preserve certain symmetries of the problem. Then, this method aims to restrict the (noiseless) evolution to the corresponding eigenspace of the symmetry operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another promising technique is the quasi-probability method. Here, we simulate a noise-free quantum computer using a noisy one, with the caveat of only producing the correct expected values of observables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are the zero-noise extrapolation, probabilistic error cancellation, and Clifford data regression methods. So, there’s plenty of room to improve the accuracy of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian simulation — even without an error-corrected and fault-tolerant quantum computer."
