# **Hands-On Guide On IBM's Quantum Open Science Prize**

IBM just announced its second **[Quantum Open Science Prize](https://research.ibm.com/blog/quantum-open-science-prize).** They ask for a solution to a quantum simulation problem. They want us to simulate a Heisenberg model Hamiltonian for a three-particle system on IBM Quantum's 7-qubit Jakarta system using Trotterization.

To be frank, unless you are already a quantum computing expert, the chances to win the $40,000 prize are rather low. However, it is a great opportunity to work on a problem that the quantum computing community really cares about solving.

I truly believe that trying to solve a problem is the best way to learn anything.

**"But what if I am a novice?"** you ask, "**what if I don't understand the physical jargon? What if I don't even know where to start?"**

Don't worry. You won't be left behind.

In my **[Hands-On Guide On IBM's Quantum Open Science Prize 2021](https://github.com/quantum-machine-learning/Hands-On-Guide-On-IBMs-Quantum-Open-Science-Prize-2021)**, we will go through all the things you'll need. It's an exciting journey ahead of us.

## About This Guide

This guide has one goal: to help you work on IBM's Quantum Open Science Prize Challenge. I am not affiliated with IBM in any kind. Therefore, I do not have any insights beyond the material that is publicly available and the results of my own work that I am willing to share with you.

Quantum computing is a field dominated by mathematicians and physicists. Yet, I’ve got a clear opinion. I believe anyone sincerely interested in quantum computing should be able to learn it.

This guide is my attempt to explain this topic in an accessible manner. Of course, we will do some math. Of course, we will cover a little physics. But I don’t expect you to hold a degree in any of these two fields.

Furthermore, this guide aims to make learning as entertaining and comprehensive as possible.
