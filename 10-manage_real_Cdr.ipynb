    "# Making CDR Ready To Work With A Real Quantum Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This post appeared first on [Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/making-cdr-ready-to-work-with-a-real-quantum-computer-fcdf270a6730) and my weekly [email-course](https://pyqml.substack.com/p/making-cdr-ready-to-work-with-a-real?s=w).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Clifford Data Regression (CDR) is a promising quantum error mitigation method. In the previous post, we effectively adapted the code from the open-source library Mitiq. As a result, we only had to apply minor adjustments to connect to the IBM Quantum cloud and to reduce the noise of a real quantum computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it takes a whole day to complete the method. It doesn't take so long because it takes so much computing time. But it takes so long because the quantum circuits we submitted to the IBM cloud have been waiting a very long time to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM offers free access to (some of) their quantum devices. But, of course, these are shared devices. When you send a quantum circuit to a quantum system on the IBM cloud, it enters a queue with jobs from other users before eventual execution. Depending on the number of enqueued jobs, it may take hours until a job runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "During our execution of the CDR, we submitted eleven circuits to the IBM cloud. The problem is that we didn't send them all immediately. But we always waited until one job was done before we sent the next. As a result, our waiting time added up significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, IBM allows us to send multiple circuits concurrently. This should reduce our overall waiting time significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last post's code, we use the `execute_with_cdr` method we import from mitiq. We call it with a custom executor as a parameter--the `real_jakarta` executor. This executor is a function that takes the quantum circuit, runs it, and returns the expectation value of the observable of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a brief look at the code of the `execute_with_cdr` function that you find [here](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/blob/master/mitiq/cdr/cdr.py). At line 155, we call the executor's `evaluate` function and pass as the parameters a list of circuits and the observable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of circuits is the training circuits plus the original circuit whose expectation value we want to calculate. The CDR method builds on learning from data how to mitigate the noise. We see that we can specify the number of training circuits we want to use on closer inspection. The default value is `10`. So, we call the evaluate function with a list of eleven circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The executor (see its code [here](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/blob/master/mitiq/executor/executor.py)) loops through the list and \"executes\" each circuit by calling the function we provided on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's briefly revisit that provided function to see how we execute a circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ...\n",
    "\n",
    "mapped_circuit = transpile(circ, backend=jakarta)\n",
    "qobj = assemble(mapped_circuit, backend=jakarta, shots=shots)\n",
    "\n",
    "# execute the circuit\n",
    "job = jakarta.run(qobj)\n",
    "\n",
    "counts = job.result().get_counts()\n",
    "\n",
    "# ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we transpile, assemble, and run the circuit on the real quantum device (Jakarta). Then, we directly obtain the's result inside the executor and, thus, inside the loop. That's the problem because `result()` is a blocking method. It does not return anything, but it waits until the job has finished. So, it waits as long as our circuit waits in the queue. Consequently, the whole loop doesn't proceed. But it waits for the result before submitting the next circuit for execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent our code from waiting, we must submit all circuits to the IBM cloud before using their results. Therefore, we need to take apart the `execute_with_cdr` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step, we prepare the training circuits. We separate this from the rest of the code because we need these circuits before and after execution."
