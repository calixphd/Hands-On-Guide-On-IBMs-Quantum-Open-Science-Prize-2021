    "# How To Set up JupyterLab To Participate In IBM's Quantum Open Science Price\n",
    "\n",
    "This post appeared first on [Medium](https://pyqml.medium.com/how-to-set-up-jupyterlab-to-participate-in-ibms-quantum-open-science-prize-1a9d44b95bf6) and my weekly [email-course](https://pyqml.substack.com/p/how-to-set-up-jupyterlab-to-participate?s=w).\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to starting a new project, configuring the development tends to be half the battle. This is especially true when we use a new technology or adhere to formal constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, while I don't know anything about your experience with quantum computing projects, there are certainly some formal constraints to consider to participate in [IBM's Quantum Open Science Prize](https://research.ibm.com/blog/quantum-open-science-prize). For instance, we need to provide an open-source Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, let's get the setup out of our way.\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM provides an [exemplary GitHub project](https://github.com/qiskit-community/open-science-prize-2021) for us to clone or fork. It contains two Jupyter notebooks that we will start with. Of course, you'll need to have Jupyter running on your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have no Jupyter environment up and running or prefer to use a virtual Dockerized environment, you may want to clone or fork [my fork of the project](https://github.com/quantum-machine-learning/Hands-On-Guide-On-IBMs-Quantum-Open-Science-Prize-2021). Then, All you need is a Unix-compatible environment (such as Ubuntu Linux or macOS) with Docker installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a Windows 10 computer, don't worry. Here's a guide on [how to set up the Linux subsystem on Windows](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-setup-jupyterlab-for-quantum-computing-on-windows-6171c0a62e62). You can stop right after you've installed Ubuntu.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, once your Ubuntu is ready, you can clone your GitHub project like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "apt-get install git\n",
    "git clone <https://github.com/YOUR CLONE OR FORK> --depth 1 --branch=main ./openprize\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first command installs `git`. The second clones the repository and puts it into the folder `openprize`. You can specify the destination folder as the last argument. You should clone your own GitHub project because you want to commit your changes to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's run the `run.sh` script\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "bash run.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This script builds and runs the system specified in the `config/jpl_config.Dockerfile`. This is another Linux system with Python 3.9, JupyterLab, and Python libraries (such as Qiskit, Numpy, Matplotlib). If you want to use any other library, add the install command there.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the script says that JupyterLab has started, open the URL [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) in a browser. You'll see the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The JupyterLab environment](./assets/jpl.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course of this challenge, you'll make various changes that you'll want to commit to your GitHub project. So, I added the [JupyterLab-Git extension](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git). It provides a graphical interface to stage, commit, and push your changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a caveat, though. GitHub doesn't support username and password-based authentication anymore. Therefore, you'll need to create and set up an SSH key.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, create a sub-folder `.ssh` in your main working directory. It will disappear instantly because it is a hidden folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"` and follow the instructions. You can find further instructions for generating the key [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).\n",
    "\n",
    "Put the key into the newly created folder `.ssh/id_ed25519` in the main working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Make sure that you don't add your key files to your repository!**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `.gitignore` of the project, I added the `.ssh`-folder. Therefore, the contents of this folder won't be added automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, get the public key by calling\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cat .ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Open your project's settings on GitHub and select \"Deploy Keys → Add deploy key.\" Next, paste your public key (it starts with ssh-ed and ends with your email address) into the text field and check the option \"Allow write access.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to specify the remote of our project. Open a terminal tab in JupyterLab and enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<your_username>/<your_repository>.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to update your repository, you can stage and commit your changes using the graphical interface. Then, you can push your commits by simply calling `git push` in a terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You need to stop (press Ctrl+C in the terminal where you called the run.sh script) and restart JupyterLab before you can push your first commit."
